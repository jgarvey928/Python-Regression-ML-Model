# Intro
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER494: Data Science for Software Engineers (2023) created by John S. Garvey for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

# Abstract
Our primary focus is on modern rates of life expectancy, but we are also going to consider the factors that might lead to higher life expectancy. The main question we are concerned with is as follows. "Does inhabitants of wealthier nations live longer life?" 

This study explores the relationship between world development indicators like GDP per capita and health-related aspects such as the prevalence of underweight children and the life expectancy for a nation. Using data from www.worldbank.org, we analyzed these correlations through a handmade predictive linear regression model. GDP per capita demonstrated a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, signifying its role in longer lifespans. Conversely, the percentage of underweight children exhibited a weaker negative correlation. Combining both indicators improved predictive accuracy, highlighting the interplay between economic prosperity and health outcomes.
