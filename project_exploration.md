## Interpretable Records
### Record 1
**Raw Data:** 
 - "Life expectancy at birth, total (years)",
 - SP.DYN.LE00.IN,
 - United States,
 - USA,
 - 76.6365853658537,
 - 76.8365853658537,
 - 76.9365853658537,
 - 77.0365853658537,
 - 77.4878048780488,
 - 77.4878048780488,
 - 77.6878048780488,
 - 77.9878048780488,
 - 78.0390243902439,
 - 78.390243902439,
 - 78.5414634146342,
 - 78.6414634146341,
 - 78.7414634146342,
 - 78.7414634146342,
 - 78.8414634146341,
 - 78.690243902439

Interpretation:** This data is reasonable or the dataset. This is the life expectancy for the 
USA which has held steady at almost 80 years old for a while.

### Record 2
**Raw Data:** 
 - GDP per capita (current US$),
 - NY.GDP.PCAP.CD,
 - Luxembourg,
 - LUX,
 - 48659.5988753233,
 - 48440.1420151355,
 - 53005.7339209179,
 - 65689.3214536911,
 - 76544.9170868473,
 - 80988.1376230858,
 - 90788.8004876145,
 - 107475.320297978,
 - 120422.137934157,
 - 109419.746953106,
 - 110885.991378724,
 - 119025.057203467,
 - 112584.676270958,
 - 120000.14072986,
 - 123678.702143273,
 - 105462.012584423

**Interpretation:** We can see from this data that Luxembourg's GDP per capita has rocketed into one of the
largest in the world. This data may not seem reasonable, but it actually is. Luxembourg has had one of the fastest 
growing and highest GDP per capita rates for any country on earth in recent years.
