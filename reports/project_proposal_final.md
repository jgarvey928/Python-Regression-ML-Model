**Keyterms:** 

Life Expectancy, Development Indicators, Prosperity,

Developed Nations: Abundance, Modern Technology, Wealthy, 

Developing Nations: Scarcity, Distressed, Poverty

**Description:**
The datasets found at www.worldbank.org we will be using are from every country in the world for the years from
1960 to 2015 and development indicators we will be analyzing are ...
- Life Expectancy from Birth 
- Gross Domestic Product per capita
- Higher-Technology Exports Percentage
- Population Ratio below National Poverty Lines
- Prevalence of Underweight Children

Our primary focus is on modern rates of life expectancy, but we are also going to consider the factors that might lead to higher life expectancy. The main question we are concerned with is as follows. "Does living in a wealthy nation lead to a longer life?" 

For the purpose of this project, we will be using a crude classification for countries with different levels of prosperity. 


**Research Questions:**
- R01: To describe any correlation trends between certain national prosperity indicators and life expectancy
- R02: To accurately predict the average life expectancy of citizens in nations with certain prosperity indicators
- R03: To defend the model performing the life expectancy prediction in R02
- R04: To evaluate certain relationships between the average life expectancy of citizens and their nations' prosperity indicators

**Intellectual Merit:** 
I believe this project does have intellectual merit for determining factors that affect life expectancy
in the twenty-first century. The knowledge we hope to gain from this project is finding evidence to support one of two 
following contradictory notions. On one hand, the citizens of developed countries are likely to be healthy because
they have no shortage of food or resources to keep them healthy, as well as access to modern medicines and technologies that 
help keep them alive when they get sick or hurt. On the other hand, people that live in societies of over-abundance tend to 
heavily suffer from health issues such as addiction and obesity. Which is reflected in the fact that the leading cause of 
death in the USA is and has been heart disease for quite some time [1]. 

The flip side of this coin is that people in developing countries obviously have much more limited access to resources such as 
food and medicine which affect their populations' health considerably. Additionally, another sad fact is that even though 
tuberculosis has been curable since the 1940s[2] it has also been, "1 of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide, 
and is the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent behind only COVID-19 and ranking above HIV/AIDS."[3] 
This lack of access to tuberculosis medication means that, "99% of deaths occur in developing countries, with the greatest 
burden in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia"[4]. Meaning if you get sick in a developing country, there is a much greater 
chance that you will not be able to get the help you need. However, again, on the other hand, people not living in a "developed" 
country are not necessarily less healthy and in fact for many societies that are still largely agricultural, "the major 
chronic diseases have low prevalence among the rural peasantry and tribal groups, with the exception of gastro-esophageal 
cancer, osteoarthritis and cataract."[5] With all of this in mind, for this project we are seeking evidence that answers 
whether living in a developed country actually means having a longer life.

**Data Sourcing:**

    1. Define Objective - Find evidence supporting whether living in developed countries leads to a longer life
    2. Identify reliable sources - the www.worldbank.org that is trustworthy and robust data source
    3. Choose data variables - we will be analyzing the ...
          - Life Expectancy from Birth 
          - Gross Domestic Product per capita
          - Higher-Technology Exports Percentage
          - Population Ratio below National Poverty Lines
          - Prevalence of Underweight Children
      4. Retrieve data - the data can be specified, and dowloaded in link below
      5. Clean data for processing - removing access information and cleaning data for processing
      6. Analysis - Exploratory data analysis of quantitative and qualitative values
      7. Interpretations - Conclusions TBD
